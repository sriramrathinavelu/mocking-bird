## Users and Groups

Hashincludetest at this point supports three types of users apart from one super admin. They are

* Regular Users
* Mentors
* Moderators

###### Regular Users:
They are the users who take tests and submit their tests for evaluation

###### Mentors:
They are the users who evaluate the test taken by regular users

###### Moderators:
They are the internal users responsible for addition of questions, company and positions to the database.

Each user is differentiated based on the Groups. For more information on django groups please visit https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/default/#groups.

The different groups in our system are
* UsersWaitingList 
* UsersVerifiedList
* ModeratorsWaitingList
* ModeratorsVerifiedList
* Moderators
* MentorsWaitingList
* MentorsVerifiedList
* Mentors

#### Life Cycle of Different Users

###### Normal User

1) A normal user signs up to the system
2) The user is put in the group "UsersWaitingList"
3) An email is sent to the user with the verification link
4) When the user verifies his email, he is added to "UsersVerifiedList"
5) Once he is in "UsersVerifiedList", he can perform all actions

###### Mentor

1) Mentor signs up a normal user but checks "I want to be a mentor" in the sign up page
2) The user is put in "UsersWaitingList" and "UsersVerifiedList"
3) An email is sent to the user with the verification link
4) When the user verified his email, he is added to "UsersVerifiedList" and "MentorsVerifiedList"
4) The superadmin can look at the list of all verified mentors and can add/reject their requests.
5) When a mentor request is accepted, the user is added to the "Mentors" group
6) Accepted mentors (in "Mentors" group) can start evaluating tests

###### Moderators

1) A moderator signs up not using the normal sign up page but uses the sign up in the admin domain
2) He is put in the "ModeratorsWaitingList" and sent a verification mail
3) On verification, the user is moved to "ModeratorsVerifiedList"
4) The superadmin can look at the list of people in "ModeratorsVerifiedList" and add/reject their requests
5) When a moderator request is accepted, the user is added to the "Moderators" group

###### User wanting to be a mentor

1) In some cases, the user is first registered as a normal user but want to become a mentor
2) In such cases, the user is already in "UsersVerifiedList"
3) When a user request to be mentor, he is put in "MentorsWaitingList" and a verification email is sent to the user
4) Upon verification, he is added to the "MentorsVerifiedList".
5) He finally becomes a mentor (and part of "Mentors" group) when the super admin accepts his request.
